                        <p>To help rural community get to development, we helped people embrace the modern agricultural technology through providing various trainings and making visits on well-established farms to watch and learn. Us the TRIP organization, monitor how they improve, and assists them.
                        <p>Through our <a href="/projects/mordernizing-banana-farming">TRIP Banana plantation project</a>, we helped the people to re-inforce the planting of banana, which was extinguishing as the time went on due to its low productions in TRIP’s operating areas. TRIP provided trainings and advice to local farmers on how the banana plant should be treated for better production. As of today, Banana plantations improvements are highly noticeable; people in our operating areas have successful transitioned from traditional agriculture to modern agriculture.

                        <p>TRIP highly values the wellbeing of people, rural development cannot be achieved when rural communities are still struggling with malnutrition diseases which are caused by unbalanced diets, Our campaign of fighting against malnutrition has taken a large effect. We taught people in our operating areas the importance of eating balanced diets and the role it have on developing the child’s brain especially in his/her first 1000 days after birth. People adopted the habit to plant various fruits and vegetable around their homes, and are urging others to do the same.
